## Current Research Areas

### 1. Computational Models of Learning and Memory

We develop and test computational models to understand how the brain learns from experience and forms memories. Our work combines:

- **Reinforcement Learning Models**: How the brain learns to make optimal decisions
- **Bayesian Brain Theories**: Understanding perception and cognition as probabilistic inference
- **Neural Network Models**: Connecting computational principles to neural mechanisms

**Current Projects:**
- Hierarchical reinforcement learning in prefrontal cortex
- Computational mechanisms of episodic memory formation
- Individual differences in learning algorithms

**Methods**: fMRI, computational modeling, behavioral experiments

### 2. Neural Mechanisms of Decision-Making

We investigate how the brain processes information to make decisions, from simple perceptual choices to complex social decisions.

**Key Questions:**
- How does the brain integrate multiple sources of information?
- What neural mechanisms support flexible decision-making?
- How do emotions influence rational choice?

**Current Projects:**
- Neural basis of value-based decision-making
- Social decision-making across the lifespan
- Decision-making under uncertainty

**Methods**: fMRI, EEG, behavioral experiments, lesion studies

### 3. Cognitive Control and Executive Function

We study how the brain controls behavior and cognition, focusing on:

- **Attention and Working Memory**: Neural mechanisms of cognitive control
- **Cognitive Flexibility**: How the brain adapts to changing environments  
- **Inhibitory Control**: Neural basis of behavioral inhibition

**Current Projects:**
- Development of cognitive control across adolescence
- Individual differences in executive function
- Cognitive control in aging

**Methods**: fMRI, EEG, neuropsychological assessment

### 4. Clinical Applications

We translate our basic research findings to understand and treat brain disorders.

**Clinical Populations:**
- Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
- Depression and anxiety disorders
- Mild cognitive impairment and dementia
- Autism spectrum disorders

**Current Projects:**
- Computational markers of psychiatric disorders
- Cognitive training interventions
- Personalized treatment approaches

**Methods**: Clinical assessments, neuroimaging, computational modeling
