  <h2>Our Research Focus</h2>
  <p>Our research addresses fundamental questions about the brain by studying the cognitive, computational, and neurobiological basis of learning, memory, and decision-making in healthy individuals (across the lifespan), and in neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p>
  
  <p>We combine an array of approaches including neuroimaging, patient studies, and computational modeling with behavioral paradigms inspired by cognitive and neuroscience theories.</p>

## Research Highlights

### Computational Neuroscience
We develop and apply computational models to understand how the brain processes information and makes decisions.

### Cognitive Neuroscience
Using neuroimaging and behavioral methods, we investigate the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive processes.

### Clinical Applications
We study how brain disorders affect cognitive function and develop interventions to improve outcomes.
