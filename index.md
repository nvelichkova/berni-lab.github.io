  <h2>Our Research Focus</h2>
  <p>Our research addresses fundamental questions about the brain by studying the cognitive, computational, and neurobiological basis of learning, memory, and decision-making in healthy individuals (across the lifespan), and in neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p>
  
  <p>We combine an array of approaches including neuroimaging, patient studies, and computational modeling with behavioral paradigms inspired by cognitive and neuroscience theories.</p>
